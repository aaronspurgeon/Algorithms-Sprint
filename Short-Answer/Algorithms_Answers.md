#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - the amount of times the while loop runs is dependant on the size of n

b) O(n log(n)) - Because it's running a for loop initially for the len(n) and a while loop within, but the while loop isn't dependant on the length of n, its dependant on j being less than n, and everytime the while loop runs j is multiplied by 2, significantly decreasing the amount of times the while loop runs.

c) O(n) - Because the amount of time the function is called recursively is dependant on the size of n.
